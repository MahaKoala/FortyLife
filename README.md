# Introduction

In my frustration one night, I decided that I've had enough of the shoddy free services that allow you to manage a Magic: The Gathering collection and it really cheesed me off to pick and pay for one specific provider that didn't have all the features that I would have wanted in a collection application. Instead of settling for one, I decided I would create one. It would have all of the bells and whistles - the best features - from all of the sites I've used and leave out all of the bad things from these sites. I then thought, I have a lot of Magic: The Gathering playing friends who also write code so I wanted to open source the effort.

This is the project for that vision. I plan to purchase the domain forty.life for this project will will host release versions of this project. Of course, anyone is free to take the project for themselves and host their own instance. We will work on an agreeable license for proper terms of use. This code is being worked on to provide a free service, so of course derivative works must be offered for free.

# Contribute!

Would you like to contribute the project? Head over to the [Issues List](https://git.tm14.net/mattn/FortyLife/issues), roll up your sleeves, and see what you can help out with.

*(Insert steps to clone repo and run project.)*

*(Include standard operating procedure (SOP) for contributing to source.)*

# Governance

The **Core Development Team (CDT)** will be in charge of the general direction the project will go. Matt N (repository owner) is currently the sole member of the CDT.

Goal: Add 4 other members to the CDT to vote on issues, merge requests, resolutions, new directions for project, and any other major design or architectural decision that need to be made to the project.

*(TODO: Implement a proper description of the powers granted by being a member of the CDT.)*

# Glossary

Because we're bound to need one eventually. Being developers, We like long, descriptive terms, but we hate typing them out every time.

* SOP -> Standard Operating Procedure: The typical routine we'll use to contribute code (and anything else) to the source.

* CDT -> Core Development Team: The five individuals who will vote on major decisions that need to be made with the direction of the project. Ideally, they'll be the five top contributors to the project.
