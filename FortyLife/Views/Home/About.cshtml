<h3>Powerful features provided at no cost.</h3>
<div>
    A project born out of frustration with the current marketshare of similar applications, Forty Life strives to provide users with all the best features from those applications while leaving out everything that makes them a chore or hassle to use. Paying money to settle for a collection manager should be a thing of the past, and we aim to make that so with this project.

    <ul>
        <li>If you disabled your ad-blocker, you'd see that Forty Life isn't bogged down with requests to ad servers and its pages don't have akward layouts in order to facilitate ads. We promise to deliver a speedy, ad-free experience. Bonus: we wont nag at you to turn off your ad-blocker! 😜</li>
        <li>100% free accounts to store all of your Magic: The Gathering deck and collection data. There will be no "pro" versions offered - every feature will be available to every user.</li>
        <li>Unlimited list storage for decks and collections alike. Decks will give you an in depth breakdown on your lists and the insight you need to build effeciently, while Collections are useful for tracking trade binders or Magic cubes.</li>
        <li>Get advice on your card lists by making them public, or store them for your own edification by making them private. Control how your public lists are critiqued by enabling or disabling comments and votes on your decks. Suggest cards for other user's lists and maintain a "Maybe" category for suggestions your lists receive to play around with different ideas in your card lists without breaking down the integrity of the original list.</li>
        <li>Light-weight but powerful list editing tools to make maintaining your different card lists quick and easy.</li>
        <li>A deck list editor with an emphasis on EDH/Commander. Easily manage your deck lists for any format imaginable with special attention paid to managing EDH/Commander lists.</li>
        <li>Card data is retreived, cached, and stored from the <a href="https://scryfall.com/docs/api">Scryfall API</a>, so Forty Life can be relied on to have the most up to date card information.</li>
        <li>Card pricing information is retreived, cached, and stored from the <a href="https://docs.tcgplayer.com/v1.20.0/reference">TCGPlayer API</a>, so Forty Life can be relied on to have the most up to date card pricing information.</li>
