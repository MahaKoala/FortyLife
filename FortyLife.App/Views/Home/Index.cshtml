    <ul>
        <li>The site shell - we have a base with which we can build off, yey!</li>
        <li>
            Very basic, name-based card search using <a href="https://scryfall.com/">Scryfall's</a> API; not very useful now - you're probably better off actually going to Scryfall for the time being!
            <ul>
                <li>An advanced search page is coming soon which will be a functional mirror of Scryfall's search.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Complete mana and card symbol parsing. Complete mana color wheel parsing. We even have set symbol parsing, now!</li>
        <li>Full support for double faced cards.</li>
        <li>
            Very informative card details page complete with rulings and printings information!
            <ul>
                <li>Pricing information coming soon, pending TCG Player's respose to my API access application.</li>
