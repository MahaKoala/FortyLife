        <li>The site shell - we have a base with which we can build off, yey!</li>
        <li>Very basic, name-based card search using <a href="https://scryfall.com/">Scryfall's</a> API; not very useful now - you're probably better off actually going to Scryfall for the time being!</li>
        <li>Imcomplete mana and card symbol parsing. The rest of the parsing engine will be hammered out soon!</li>
